This is the audio_files folder; it houses all audio files that you may want to use in your program. 
There are 2 new built-in functions that allow you to play an audio file that you can see below:

#1 -> playAudioFile(String file_name)
#2 -> stopAudioFile(String file_name)

These functions are self-explanatory, but there's a few notes that I want to make:

- So far the only file type that I know is compatible is the .wav file type. You can google .wav converters online, or
you can use a free program called Audacity to create .wav type audio files;

- You can play the same file multiple times simultaneously, but if you'd like to stop any file from playing, the 
stopAudioFile() function will stop all instances that are playing at once. 

- Lastly, in regards to .wav converters and the previously mentioned program called Audacity, here are some links that may be 
useful to you if you would like to incorporate some kind of audio into your application.

You can also use this program to export the .wav file type if you rather not use the online file converter.
